Basically trying to learn how to deploy code.

Going to use the tools present in Grail.

Which is:
1) AWS
2) Terraform
3) Bash + Python
4) Docker
5) BuildKite
  a) Gonna substitute in GitLab, since that one is free and does the same damn thing
6) Phabricator
  a) Gonna use GitHub, since why not


The plan:
1) Make a super simple thing to "deploy"
  a) Maybe Python Flask? Basically focusing on the infrastructure side of things
    So not focusing on making my ToDoApp to be deployable...until it's ready.
    So deploy something simple just to get experience.

2) Make tests, and cool stuff
