This is purely for experimenting and getting used to the
infrastructure side of things.

The overarching goal:
- Deploy a static website on AWS (most like EC2)

The tools that I want to get familiar with
- AWS (S3, EC2, ECS, RDS)
- Terraform
- GitLab
- Python + Bash
- Docker

The above will take a while to understand and get used to

I know there are easier tools, but I feel like keeping it generic enough, 
I will get more transferrable skills
